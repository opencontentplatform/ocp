Open Content Platform: Open-Source IT Discovery and Integration Platform

Project Motivation
------------------
IT Service Management (ITSM) is well established with proprietary tool coverage for 20 years.  If youâ€™re not familiar with the space, vendor names have included HP, IBM, BMC, CA, Service Now, Micro Focus, Cherwell, Ivanti, and others.

So why create an open-source offering for IT discovery and integration activities?

  * Software discovery and dependency mapping across servers, without having to create software signatures.
  * Modernize the underlying platform to enable horizontal, on-demand scalability in the discovery framework.
  * Add new methodologies into the discovery framework; more than just the 1-to-1 model of job-to-technology.
  * Jobs could be vendor agnostic; develop once and send to any ITSM product.
  * Create a larger developer resource pool by combining talent across vendors.
  * Crowd-sourcing jobs; enable individual developers to compete with big vendors and their partner ecosystems.
  * Expand ITSM customer base to companies with less than 5,000 servers; everyone can afford open-source!
